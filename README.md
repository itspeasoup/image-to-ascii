# image-to-ascii
literally what it says lmao
this is a simple program that converts images to ascii art. it uses the pillow library to open and manipulate images, and the tkinter library to create a simple GUI.

so you'll be met with a little funky window:

by the feather, you can instantly discover i used tkinter for the gui and pyinstaller for the exe.

of course, it's not rocket science, as
"open image" literally does what it says (opens explorer allowing you to **open** a thing):

i will be using this image.

now, your window should have the image loaded and shown:

if you're wondering where the result is, it's directly below the "text size" value. the result is already done, i just need to scroll down because it uses ✨*spaces*✨ instead of an actual symbol for a transparent pixel. that works for white backgrounds as well!

scrolling down gives you a weird salad with some text because i'm too lazy to make a proper method of showing the result:

to copy it, just click on the text box, then ctrl+a and then ctrl+c since there's no direct context menu for that so i hope you have a keyboard.

to see the results, **just open notepad**, and paste it in. you then get your result.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> "I want the image bigger or smaller!" - okay billy that's what the text size is for: it works like image resolution, so making it like 10 makes it a 10x10 text canvas and it's useless for that image because it gives you one symbol:

> on the other hand, making the resolution size **big** like 1024 then you're gonna get an image that has MUCH higher quality but is MUCH bigger you're gonna need to zoom all the way out on that:
